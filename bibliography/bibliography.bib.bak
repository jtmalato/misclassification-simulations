  abstract  = {Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are serious, debilitating conditions that affect millions of people in the United States and around the world. ME\/CFS can cause significant impairment and disability. Despite substantial efforts by researchers to better understand ME\/CFS, there is no known cause or effective treatment. Diagnosing the disease remains a challenge, and patients often struggle with their illness for years before an identification is made. Some health care providers have been skeptical about the serious physiological - rather than psychological - nature of the illness. Once diagnosed, patients often complain of receiving hostility from their health care provider as well as being subjected to treatment strategies that exacerbate their symptoms.\nBeyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis\/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome proposes new diagnostic clinical criteria for ME\/CFS and a new term for the illness - systemic exertion intolerance disease(SEID). According to this report, the term myalgic encephalomyelitis does not accurately describe this illness, and the term chronic fatigue syndrome can result in trivialization and stigmatization for patients afflicted with this illness. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis\/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome stresses that SEID is a medical - not a psychiatric or psychological - illness. This report lists the major symptoms of SEID and recommends a diagnostic process.One of the report's most important conclusions is that a thorough history, physical examination, and targeted work-up are necessary and often sufficient for diagnosis. The new criteria will allow a large percentage of undiagnosed patients to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate care.\nBeyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis\/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome will be a valuable resource to promote the prompt diagnosis of patients with this complex, multisystem, and often devastating disorder; enhance public understanding; and provide a firm foundation for future improvements in diagnosis and treatment.},

  abstract  = {The chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), formerly known as chronic Epstein-Barr virus syndrome, is a clinical state of some complexity and uncertain etiology. In order to characterize in a comprehensive manner the status of laboratory markers associated with cellular immune function in patients with this syndrome, 30 patients with clinically defined CFS were studied. All of the subjects were found to have multiple abnormalities in these markers. The most consistent immunological abnormality detected among these patients, when compared with normal controls, was low natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity. The number of NK cells, as defined by reactivity with monoclonal antibody NKH.1 (CD56), was elevated, but the killing of K562 tumor cells per CD56 cell was significantly diminished. Lymphoproliferative responses after stimulation with phytohemagglutinin and pokeweed mitogen were decreased in most patients when compared with those in normal controls, as was the production of gamma interferon following mitogen stimulation. Lymphocyte phenotypic marker analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes showed that there were significant differences between patients with CFS and controls. There was an increase in the percentage of suppressor-cytotoxic T lymphocytes, CD8, and a proportionally larger increase in the number of CD8 cells expressing the class II activation marker. Most patients had an elevated number of CD2 cells which expressed the activation marker CDw26. The numbers of CD4 cells and the helper subset of CD4+CD29+ cells in patients with CFS were not different from those in controls. There was, however, a significant decrease in the suppressor inducer subset of CD4+ CD45RA+ cells. The number of B cells, CD20 and CD21, were elevated, as were the numbers of a subset of B cells which coexpressed CD20 and CD5. The patterns of immune marker abnormalities observed was compatible with a chronic viral reactivation syndrome.},

Patients are often incapacitated and stigmatized as having a psychological disorder. The Chronic Fatigue Attitudes Test (CAT) assesses stigmatizing views toward individuals with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, however, there is little research examining factors that may account for variation in stigmatizing attitudes toward this group. We examined CAT scores among college age research volunteers (N = 90), hypothesizing that exposure to information about ME and CFS as a result of volunteering on a ME and CFS-related research project would be associated with less stigmatizing attitudes compared to volunteers on unrelated projects. Findings indicated that ME and CFS research volunteers expressed less stigmatizing attitudes. Educational efforts aiming to disseminate accurate information about ME and CFS may mitigate stigma and the experience of stigma among individuals with ME and CFS.},

  abstract = {Objective
Fatigue is common in autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARD). This study compared symptom-related cognitions, beliefs, behaviours, quality of sleep, lack of acceptance and distress in participants with ARD such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), seronegative spondyloarthropathy (SpA), and connective tissue disease (CTD), and participants with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).
Methods
303 participants with RA, SpA, CTD and CFS completed questionnaire measures of fatigue, social adjustment, cognitive-behavioural responses, lack of acceptance, distress and quality of sleep. The RA, SpA and CTD groups were first compared with each other. They were then combined into one group and compared with the CFS group.
Results
There were no statistically significant differences between the RA, SpA or CTD groups for any of the measures. The CFS group was more fatigued, reported more distress and sleep disturbance and had worse social adjustment than the ARD group after adjustment for age and illness duration. After adjustment for fatigue, age, and illness duration, the CFS group scored more highly on lack of acceptance and avoidance/resting behaviour while the ARD group showed significantly higher levels of catastrophizing, damage beliefs, and symptom focusing than the CFS group.
Conclusion
Fatigue in rheumatic diseases may be perpetuated by similar underlying transdiagnostic processes. The ARD and CFS groups showed similarities but also key differences in their responses to symptoms. Specific aspects of treatment may need to be tailored towards each group. For example, lack of acceptance and avoidance behaviour may be particularly important in perpetuating fatigue in CFS.},

  abstract     = {Infections by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are often at the disease onset of patients suffering from Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). However, serological analyses of these infections remain inconclusive when comparing patients with healthy controls. In particular, it is unclear if certain EBV-derived antigens eliciting antibody responses have a biomarker potential for disease diagnosis. With this purpose, we re-analysed a previously published microarray data on the IgG antibody responses against 3,054 EBV-related antigens in 92 patients with ME/CFS and 50 HCs. This re-analysis consisted of constructing different regression models for binary outcomes with the ability to classify patients and HCs. In these models, we tested for a possible interaction of different antibodies with age and gender. When analyzing the whole data set, there were no antibody responses that could be used to distinguish patients from healthy controls. A similar finding was obtained when comparing patients with noninfectious or unknown disease trigger to healthy controls. However, when data analysis was restricted to the comparison between HCs and patients with a putative infection at disease onset, we could identify stronger antibody responses against two candidate antigens (EBNA4_0529 and EBNA6_0070). Using antibody responses to these two antigens together with age and gender, the final classification model had an estimated sensitivity and specificity of 0.833 and 0.720, respectively. This reliable case-control discrimination suggested the use of the antibody levels related to these candidate viral epitopes as biomarkers for disease diagnosis in this subgroup of patients. When a bioinformatic analysis was performed on these epitopes, it revealed a potential molecular mimicry with several human proteins. To confirm these promising findings, a follow-up study will be conducted in a separate cohort of patients.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNS, EL, and CS received funding from ME Research UK (SCIO Charity Number SC036942) for this project.
