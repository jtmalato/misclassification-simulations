# data-cluster folder

The data in this folder is organised as

* `simulation-structure`: Datasets with the combination of all parametric values to be used by the simulation functions.
* `simulation-results`: Output generated from each simulation.

Simulations on the parameters data generated the results for

* `candidate-gene`: Hypothetical study on the impact of ME/CFS misdiagnosis.
* `serology-or`: Hypothetical study on the impact of ME/CFS misdiagnosis and misclassification on the candidate causal factor.
* `steiner2020`: Application to candidate gene association study.
* `cliff2019`: Application to serology association study.

Note: 
At some point in the analysis, simulations on data from the two ME/CFS studies were done considering the application of the Fisher's exact test as an alternative to the Pearson's chi-squared test. Results for this can be seen in `steiner2020-2test` and `cliff2019-2test`.
